## About The Project

Creates an interface between Huggingface Inference API and the Discord API.  

This project allows:
* A discord bot to send message text to a huggingface inference API to any available model, send the output back to discord.
  * Ping the bot directly to start a new conversation.
  * Reply to a previous response from the bot to continue an existing conversation.

## Getting Started

The HuggingFace Discord Interface project uses gradle as a built tool. The project includes a gradle wrapper so that gradle does not need to be installed ahead of time.
All examples assume that they will be ran in a bourne shell. If using powershell or Window's command prompt, you may need to modify the commands to use `gradlew.bat` instead of `gradlew`.

### Prerequisites

The following tools are required to begin.
* Java 17 (for example [Amazon Corretto](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-17-ug/downloads-list.html))
  * `JAVA_HOME` environment variable must be set
  * `PATH` environment variable must include the bin directory from `JAVA_HOME`
* Docker installed if running the project inside Docker.
